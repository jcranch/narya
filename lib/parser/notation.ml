(* A notation is either open or closed, on both sides.  We call these two properties combined its "fixity", since they are equivalent to the traditional classification as infix, prefix, postfix, or "outfix".

   A notation is left-associative, right-associative, or non-associative.  It can only be associative on a side where it is open, i.e. only an infix or prefix notation can meaningfully be right-associative, while only an infix or postfix notation can meaningfully be left-associative.  Thus, instead of storing associativity separately, we store a "strictness" along with openness. *)

(* A "notation tree" (not to be confused with a "parse tree", which is the *result* of parsing) carries the information about how to parse one or more notations.  Each individual notation is defined by giving one tree, but multiple such trees can also be "merged" together.  This allows different notations that start out looking the same to be parsed with minimal backtracking, as we don't need to "decide" which notation we're parsing until we get to the point of the tree where they diverge.  Accordingly, although each notation is associated to a defining tree, a tree also stores pointers to notations at its leaves, since a merged tree could parse many different notations depending on which path through it is taken. *)

(* The trees corresponding to notations that are open on one side or the other do *not* record the existence of the leftmost or rightmost subterm: they only record the positions of the operators and fully delimited "inner" subterms.  Thus, a notation tree does not fully characterize the behavior of a notation until paired with the information of its openness on each side. *)

(* When there is a choice in parsing, we arrange it so that no backtracking is required (except for a single token of lookahead).  We test all the possible next literal tokens, considering the possibility of a notation operator, field, or other term.  (Constructors and identifiers are considered special terms, and extracted during postprocessing.)  Fields cannot also be other terms, and we forbid symbols that occur in operators from also being variable names, so there is no need for backtracking. *)

(* If we weren't using intrinsically well-scoped De Bruijn indices, then the typechecking context and the type of raw terms would be simply ordinary types, and we could use the one as the parsing State and the other as the parsing Result.  However, the Fmlib parser isn't set up to allow a parametrized family of state types, with the output of a parsing combinator depending on the state (and it would be tricky to do that correctly anyway).  So instead we record the result of parsing as a syntax tree with idents, and have a separate step of "postprocessing" that makes it into a raw term.  This has the additional advantage that by parsing and pretty-printing we can reformat code even if it is not well-scoped. *)
and observation = Term : ('lt, 'ls, 'rt, 'rs) parse located -> observation

(* A parsed notation, with its own tightness and openness, and lying in specified left and right tightness intervals, has a Bwd of observations in its inner holes, plus possibly a first and/or last term depending on its openness.  It is parametrized by the openness and tightness of the notation, and also by upper tightness intervals from the left and right in which it is guaranteed to lie.  Thus, the first and last term (if any) can be guaranteed statically to be valid, and we may require witnesses that the notation is tight enough on the left and/or the right (also depending on its openness) to fit in the specified intervals.  The whitespace argument stores the comments and whitespace attached after each operator token. *)

(* A notation has a precedence, which we call "tightness" to make it obvious that higher numbers bind more tightly, and is a floating-point number.  Using a DAG for precedence, as in Danielsson-Norell, is a nice idea, but it seems to require a lot of backtracking: if when parsing the right-hand argument of a notation âˆ§ you encounter a notation * that isn't tighter than âˆ§, you can't know yet that it is forbidden; you have to keep parsing in case you encounter another notation like = that is tighter than âˆ§ and looser than *, or in fact multiple such notations forming some arbitrarily complicated path through the DAG.  This is incompatible with the minimal-backtracking approach we take, so we stick to numerical tightnesses.

   Our approach is based on the parsing technique of Pratt.  This means that a notation that's closed on both sides doesn't need a tightness at all (it behaves like the highest possible tightness on a closed side); in practice they end up with +Ï‰.  User-defined notations that are open on at least one side have finite tightness, while +Ï‰ and âˆ’Ï‰ tightness are reserved for internal built-in notations (let-in, abstraction, and ascription are âˆ’Ï‰, while all outfix notations such as parentheses (and also, morally, application) have tightness +Ï‰. *)
