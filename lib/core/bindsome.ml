  (* Ordinary contexts are "backwards" lists.  Following Cockx's thesis, in this file we call the forwards version "telescopes", since they generally are going to get appended to a "real", backwards, context.  A telescope has *three* indices:

     1. A raw length that is a forwards natural number, like the backwards natural numbers that are the raw indices of contexts.
     3. A checked length that is a forwards Tlist of dimensions, like the backwards Tbwd of dimensions that are the checked indices of contexts.
     2. A forwards Tlist of backwards natural numbers that flattens to the raw length.  We could index contexts by an analogous backwards Tbwd of nats, but we don't have any need for that so far.  But retaining this index for telescopes is crucial to constructing the correct permutations in bind_some, below, in an intrinsically well-typed way. *)

  (* Now we begin the suite of helper functions for bind_some.  This is an operation that happens during typechecking a pattern match, when the match variable along with all its indices have to be replaced by values determined by the constructor of each branch.  This requires the context to be re-sorted at the same time to maintain a consistent dependency structure, with each type and value depending only on the variables to its left.

     It also requires "substitution into values", which we do by reading back values into the old context and then evaluating them in the new context.  However, readback and evaluation are defined in other files, and readback depends on this file since readback happens *in* a context.  So we define these operations to take a "readback-then-eval" callback function as an argument.  It has to be wrapped up in a record so as to be polymorphic, and we include two different versions of it acting on normals and values.  In addition, these callbacks return an option indicating whether readback succeeded, where failure means that not all the level variables in the input value appear in the readback context.  For normal readback such a failure is a fatal error, but in this case it just means we need to permute some other variables past the present one, so we require the caller to capture that error and return None instead.  Here's the record. *)

  (* We define bind_some and its helper functions in reverse order from the order in which they're called, so that each one can call the already-defined next one in line.  We could put them in the other order by making them mutual, but I prefer to avoid mutuality when it's unnecessary, and also this way each one can be next to the definition of its GADT return type.  But it is probably better to read them in reverse order, starting with bind_some lower down.  The call process goes as follows:

     1. Typechecking during a match calls bind_some, passing it the context and a callback function that picks out the level variables to be re-bound and their associated values (which are in that context).

     2. bind_some shuffles the context entirely to the right into a telescope, and computes the corresponding Tlist of nats and flattened forwards nat (representing the same raw length).  Then it calls go_bind_some with these data and two empty contexts "oldctx" and "newctx".

     3. go_bind_some is passed (in addition to the rebinding callback and flattening data) two contexts of the same (raw and checked) lengths, oldctx and newctx, as well as a telescope.  It and its callees maintain the invariant that oldctx appended by the telescope is a permutation of the old context, containing the *old* level variables and their types, unsubstituted by the rebinding callbar (now no longer in order); while newctx contains the same variables as oldctx, in the same order (which is the new correct order), but now with new level variables and the rebinding substitutions made.  It returns a completed permuted context, along with data recording the resulting permutation and flattening.

     4. go_go_bind_some is passed mostly the same data as go_bind_some, but its job is only to find the *next* variable from the unprocessed telescope to add to oldctx and newctx.  Thus, it recurses through that telescope, trying for each cube of variables to readback all the types and values in oldctx and then evaluate them in newctx.  As soon as it finds one that succeeds, it excises that entry from the telescope and returns both the old entry, the readback-evaluated version, and the telescope with that entry removed (plus information about where it was removed from, which is used to construct the permutations).

     5. Thus, go_bind_some proceeds by calling go_go_bind_some, adding the returned entries to oldctx and newctx, and then calling itself recursively on the remaining telescope.  If the telescope is emptied, we have succeeded and we return.  But if go_go_bind_some fails on all entries of a nonempty telescope, the whole process fails.  (I think this should never happen and indicates a bug; anything the user might do that would cause that should be caught earlier.)

     6. go_go_bind_some acts on each entry with bind_some_entry, whose real work is done by bind_some_normal_cube that acts on a cube of variables with the binder callback and readback-eval.  Since that function is the one we define first, we now proceed to comment its definition directly. *)

  (* This seems an appropriate place to comment about the "insert" and "append_permute" data being returned from (go_)go_bind_some.  The issue is that in addition to a permuted context, we need to compute the permutation relating it to the original context.  In fact we need *two* permutations, one for the raw indices and one for the checked indices.

     The one for the checked indices is more straightforward to compute, because the checked indices are a list of dimensions and we construct the permutation directly working with that list.  Our definition of permutations in terms of iterated insertions closely matches how we construct the permutation, picking out one entry at a time from the remaining ones.  The data structure Tbwd.append_permute is designed to capture the construction of a permutation in this way.

     The one for the raw indices is trickier because it acts as a "block" permutation, with all the raw variables in each Split entry being permuted as a group.  It seems that this permutation should be determined by the permutation of checked indices, but confusingly, that isn't quite true, because the number of raw indices corresponding to a single cube of variables (which is one entry in the checked-index dimension list) depends on what kind of entry it is -- visible, invisible, or split -- which is not recorded in the index *type*.  Our solution is to construct, as we go along, a parallel type list of *natural numbers*, which flattens to the raw index type, and a permutation of it.  Thus go_go_bind some returns *two* 'Tlist.insert's, and go_bind_some returns *two* 'Tbwd.append_permute's, while bind_some flattens and dices them to make a single N.perm and Tbwd.permute. *)
