(* ******************** Groups of terms ******************** *)

(* At both the checked and the value level we have actually two different types to define: ordinary terms and case trees.  However, there is some overlap in the types of constructors and operations that these support: they can both contain lambda-abstractions and structs.  Thus, to avoid duplication of code, we actually define both together as one GADT type family, indexed by a two-element type to distinguish them.  We name the two groups after the two kinds of energy:

   - Ordinary terms are "kinetic", because ordinary computation applies directly to them.
   - Case trees are "potential", because they don't compute until enough arguments are applied to reach a leaf of the case tree.  That leaf can be either a kinetic term or information about a canonical type (which is not a computation, just a specification of behavior).
*)

type kinetic = Dummy_kinetic
type potential = Dummy_potential
type _ energy = Kinetic : kinetic energy | Potential : potential energy

(* Structs can have or lack eta-conversion, but the only kinetic ones are the ones with eta (records). *)
type _ eta = Eta : 's eta | Noeta : potential eta

module Raw = struct
  (* Raw (unchecked) terms, using intrinsically well-scoped De Bruijn indices, and separated into synthesizing terms and checking terms.  These match the user-facing syntax rather than the internal syntax.  In particular, applications, abstractions, and pi-types are all unary, there is only one universe, and the only operator actions are refl (including Id) and sym. *)

  (* A raw De Bruijn index is a well-scoped natural number together with a possible face.  During typechecking we will verify that the face, if given, is applicable to the variable as a "cube variable", and compile the combination into a more strongly well-scoped kind of index. *)

(* ******************** Typechecked terms ******************** *)

(* Typechecked, but unevaluated, terms.  Use De Bruijn indices that are intrinsically well-scoped by hctxs, but are no longer separated into synthesizing and checking; hence without type ascriptions.  Note that extending an hctx by a dimension 'k means adding a whole cube of new variables, which are indexed by the position of that dimension together with a strict face of it.  (At user-level, those variables may all be accessed as faces of one "cube variable", or they may have independent names, but internally there is no difference.)

   Incorporates information appropriate to the internal syntax that is constructed during typechecking, e.g. applications and abstractions are grouped by a dimension, since this can be inferred during typechecking, from the synthesized type of a function being applied and from the pi-type the lambda is being checked against, respectively.  Similarly, we have instantiations of higher-dimensional types obtained by applying them to a tube of boundary terms.

   Typechecking of user syntax still produces only unary pi-types and zero-dimensional universes, but we include arbitrary-dimensional ones here so that they can also be the output of readback from internal values.  We likewise include arbitrary degeneracy actions, since these can appear in readback. *)

(* The codomain of a higher-dimensional pi-type is a cube of terms with bound variables whose number varies with the face of the cube.  We can enforce this with a parametrized instance of Cube, but it has to be defined recursively with term using a recursive module (like BindCube in Value; see there for more commentary). *)
