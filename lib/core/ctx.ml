(* To first approximation, a context is a list of variables, each of which has a value that is a normal form.  Often the "value" of a variable will just be ITSELF, represented by a De Bruijn LEVEL, together of course with its type.  This can then appear in the types of later variables.  In particular, the LENGTH of this context, which is its type parameter as a type-level nat, is the current De Bruijn LEVEL for new variables to be added.

   We can look up the INDEX of a TERM VARIABLE into this Bwv to get its type.  This operation is statically guaranteed to succeed, since all De Bruijn indices are intrinsically well-scoped.

   We can also look up the LEVEL of a VALUE VARIABLE to find its corresponding term-variable index (and we do this during readback).  However, this operation is not statically guaranteed to succeed.  Indeed, in some cases it we intend for it to fail, e.g. during an occurs-check.  To enable this operation, we separately store for each index variable its corresponding level, if any, in addition to its value.  (If it is let-bound to a value, then it has no associated level variable.) *)

(* To second approximation, a "context" is actually a WEAKENING SUBSTITUTION from one De Bruijn INDEX context to another.  The index variables that arise from parsing are counted based on the number of textually in-scope variables, but internally there may be variables other than these, for instance if a pattern binds some arguments implicitly.  Thus, an element of (a, b) Ctx.t is actually a length-b context in which only a of the variables are "visible".  We then use b for counting the next De Bruijn LEVEL to create, and for De Bruijn INDICES IN CHECKED TERMS, as well as for readback.  However, since the user can only refer to a of the variables, and the parser doesn't know about invisible variables (they are determined by semantic considerations, e.g. implicit arguments of constructors in match patterns), we use a for De Bruijn INDICES IN RAW TERMS.  This means the index of a variable can change when it is typechecked, but our intrinsically well-scoped indices manage this issue smoothly, ensuring that the correct kind of index is always used in the correct place. *)

(* To third approximation, a context is not a flat list of variables, but a list of "cubes" of variables.  Frequently when introducing variables, we introduce a whole cube of them (e.g. when abstracting into a higher-dimensional pi-type, or pattern-matching against a higher-dimensional datatype), and we avoid "linearizing" these variables as much as possible.  Thus, index variables are not just a (well-scoped) natural number, but are paired with a dimension and a strict face of that dimension, and variables are stored in cubes.

   More precisely, the RAW parameter 'a is a simple type-level natural number, since the parser can't tell what dimensions things have, and a raw index variable is paired with a face of an arbitrary dimension corresponding to how the user used it.  However, the CHECKED parameter 'b is actually a type-level list of dimensions (an "hctx"), and a checked index variable is paired with a face *of the corresponding dimension*.  For level variables we use a pair of integers: one for the position in the context, and the other that counts through the variables in each cube.  (Since levels are only ever compared for equality, the ordering of the latter numbers doesn't matter.) *)

(* To fourth approximation, a context (qua substitution) can also incorporate a permutation of the raw indices.  This is because the raw indices occur in the order that they are bound *textually*, whereas we require that the checked indices occur in a "logical" order so that the type and possible value of each variable involves only those appearing prior to it.  These can disconnect during a match, where the new variables bound as arguments of the matched constructor are last textually, but must be inserted earlier in the context to retain logical order.  We postpone this modification until later, first defining "Ordered" contexts and then adding the permutations. *)

(* The binding of each variable in a context is a "level option * normal".  But instead of exposing this literally as a product type, we use an abstract type with a constructor "Binding.make" and accessors "Binding.level" and "Binding.value".  The reason is that in the "bind_some" machinery below, we work with contexts where the binding of a variable is "known but not yet available" or "not yet computed".  So the internal implementation of Binding is actually a reference cell that usually stores a "Known" "level option * normal", but sometimes is Unknown or other times a Delayed "level option * normal". *)
