(* To first approximation, a context is a list of variables, each of which has a value that is a normal form.  Often the "value" of a variable will just be ITSELF, represented by a De Bruijn LEVEL, together of course with its type.  This can then appear in the types of later variables.  In particular, the LENGTH of this context, which is its type parameter as a type-level nat, is the current De Bruijn LEVEL for new variables to be added.

   We can look up the INDEX of a TERM VARIABLE into this Bwv to get its type.  This operation is statically guaranteed to succeed, since all De Bruijn indices are intrinsically well-scoped.

   We can also look up the LEVEL of a VALUE VARIABLE to find its corresponding term-variable index (and we do this during readback).  However, this operation is not statically guaranteed to succeed.  Indeed, in some cases it we intend for it to fail, e.g. during an occurs-check.  To enable this operation, we separately store for each index variable its corresponding level, if any, in addition to its value.  (If it is let-bound to a value, then it has no associated level variable.) *)

(* To second approximation, a "context" is actually a WEAKENING SUBSTITUTION from one De Bruijn INDEX context to another.  The index variables that arise from parsing are counted based on the number of textually in-scope variables, but internally there may be variables other than these, for instance if a pattern binds some arguments implicitly.  Thus, an element of (a, b) Ctx.t is actually a length-b context in which only a of the variables are "visible".  We then use b for counting the next De Bruijn LEVEL to create, and for De Bruijn INDICES IN CHECKED TERMS, as well as for readback.  However, since the user can only refer to a of the variables, and the parser doesn't know about invisible variables (they are determined by semantic considerations, e.g. implicit arguments of constructors in match patterns), we use a for De Bruijn INDICES IN RAW TERMS.  This means the index of a variable can change when it is typechecked, but our intrinsically well-scoped indices manage this issue smoothly, ensuring that the correct kind of index is always used in the correct place. *)

(* To third approximation, a context is not a flat list of variables, but a list of "cubes" of variables.  Frequently when introducing variables, we introduce a whole cube of them (e.g. when abstracting into a higher-dimensional pi-type, or pattern-matching against a higher-dimensional datatype), and we avoid "linearizing" these variables as much as possible.  Thus, index variables are not just a (well-scoped) natural number, but are paired with a dimension and a strict face of that dimension, and variables are stored in cubes.

   More precisely, the RAW parameter 'a is a simple type-level natural number, since the parser can't tell what dimensions things have, and a raw index variable is paired with a face of an arbitrary dimension corresponding to how the user used it.  However, the CHECKED parameter 'b is actually a type-level list of dimensions (an "hctx"), and a checked index variable is paired with a face *of the corresponding dimension*.  For level variables we use a pair of integers: one for the position in the context, and the other that counts through the variables in each cube.  (Since levels are only ever compared for equality, the ordering of the latter numbers doesn't matter.) *)

(* To fourth approximation, a context (qua substitution) can also incorporate a permutation of the raw indices.  This is because the raw indices occur in the order that they are bound *textually*, whereas we require that the checked indices occur in a "logical" order so that the type and possible value of each variable involves only those appearing prior to it.  These can disconnect during a match, where the new variables bound as arguments of the matched constructor are last textually, but must be inserted earlier in the context to retain logical order.  We postpone this modification until later, first defining "Ordered" contexts and then adding the permutations. *)

(* The binding of each variable in a context is a "level option * normal".  But instead of exposing this literally as a product type, we use an abstract type with a constructor "Binding.make" and accessors "Binding.level" and "Binding.value".  The reason is that in the "bind_some" machinery below, we work with contexts where the binding of a variable is "known but not yet available" or "not yet computed".  So the internal implementation of Binding is actually a reference cell that usually stores a "Known" "level option * normal", but sometimes is Unknown or other times a Delayed "level option * normal". *)

  (* Now we begin the suite of helper functions for bind_some.  This is an operation that happens during typechecking a pattern match, when the match variable along with all its indices have to be replaced by values determined by the constructor of each branch.  This requires the context to be re-sorted at the same time to maintain a consistent dependency structure, with each type and value depending only on the variables to its left.

     It also requires "substitution into values", which we do by reading back values into the old context and then evaluating them in the new context.  However, readback and evaluation are defined in other files, and readback depends on this file since readback happens *in* a context.  So we define these operations to take a "readback-then-eval" callback function as an argument.  It has to be wrapped up in a record so as to be polymorphic, and we include two different versions of it acting on normals and values.  In addition, these callbacks return an option indicating whether readback succeeded, where failure means that not all the level variables in the input value appear in the readback context.  For normal readback such a failure is a fatal error, but in this case it just means we need to permute some other variables past the present one, so we require the caller to capture that error and return None instead.  Here's the record. *)

  type eval_readback = {

  (* We define bind_some and its helper functions in reverse order from the order in which they're called, so that each one can call the already-defined next one in line.  We could put them in the other order by making them mutual, but I prefer to avoid mutuality when it's unnecessary, and also this way each one can be next to the definition of its GADT return type.  But it is probably better to read them in reverse order, starting with bind_some lower down.  The call process goes as follows:

     1. Typechecking during a match calls bind_some, passing it the context and a callback function that picks out the level variables to be re-bound and their associated values (which are in that context).

     2. bind_some shuffles the context entirely to the right into a telescope, and computes the corresponding Tlist of nats and flattened forwards nat (representing the same raw length).  Then it calls go_bind_some with these data and two empty contexts "oldctx" and "newctx".

     3. go_bind_some is passed (in addition to the rebinding callback and flattening data) two contexts of the same (raw and checked) lengths, oldctx and newctx, as well as a telescope.  It and its callees maintain the invariant that oldctx appended by the telescope is a permutation of the old context, containing the *old* level variables and their types, unsubstituted by the rebinding callbar (now no longer in order); while newctx contains the same variables as oldctx, in the same order (which is the new correct order), but now with new level variables and the rebinding substitutions made.  It returns a completed permuted context, along with data recording the resulting permutation and flattening.

     4. go_go_bind_some is passed mostly the same data as go_bind_some, but its job is only to find the *next* variable from the unprocessed telescope to add to oldctx and newctx.  Thus, it recurses through that telescope, trying for each cube of variables to readback all the types and values in oldctx and then evaluate them in newctx.  As soon as it finds one that succeeds, it excises that entry from the telescope and returns both the old entry, the readback-evaluated version, and the telescope with that entry removed (plus information about where it was removed from, which is used to construct the permutations).

     5. Thus, go_bind_some proceeds by calling go_go_bind_some, adding the returned entries to oldctx and newctx, and then calling itself recursively on the remaining telescope.  If the telescope is emptied, we have succeeded and we return.  But if go_go_bind_some fails on all entries of a nonempty telescope, the whole process fails.  (I think this should never happen and indicates a bug; anything the user might do that would cause that should be caught earlier.)

     6. go_go_bind_some acts on each entry with bind_some_entry, whose real work is done by bind_some_normal_cube that acts on a cube of variables with the binder callback and the readback-eval callback.  Since that function is the one we define first, we now proceed to comment its definition directly. *)

  (* This seems an appropriate place to comment about the "insert" and "append_permute" data being returned from (go_)go_bind_some.  The issue is that in addition to a permuted context, we need to compute the permutation relating it to the original context.  In fact we need *two* permutations, one for the raw indices and one for the checked indices.

     The one for the checked indices is more straightforward to compute, because the checked indices are a list of dimensions and we construct the permutation directly working with that list.  Our definition of permutations in terms of iterated insertions closely matches how we construct the permutation, picking out one entry at a time from the remaining ones.  The data structure Tbwd.append_permute is designed to capture the construction of a permutation in this way.

     The one for the raw indices is trickier because it acts as a "block" permutation, with all the raw variables in each Split entry being permuted as a group.  It seems that this permutation should be determined by the permutation of checked indices, but confusingly, that isn't quite true, because the number of raw indices corresponding to a single cube of variables (which is one entry in the checked-index dimension list) depends on what kind of entry it is -- visible, invisible, or split -- which is not recorded in the index *type*.  Our solution is to construct, as we go along, a parallel type list of *natural numbers*, which flattens to the raw index type, and a permutation of it.  Thus go_go_bind some returns *two* 'Tlist.insert's, and go_bind_some returns *two* 'Tbwd.append_permute's, while bind_some flattens and dices them to make a single N.perm and Tbwd.permute. *)
