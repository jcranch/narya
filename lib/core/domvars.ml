(* To typecheck a lambda, do an eta-expanding equality check, check pi-types for equality, or read back a pi-type or a term at a pi-type, we must create one new variable for each argument in the boundary.  Sometimes we need these variables as values and other times as normals.  The function dom_vars creates these variables and returns them in two cubes.  It, and the function ext_tel below that follows from it, are in a separate file because it depends on Inst and Ctx and is used in Equal, Readback, and Check, and doesn't seem to be placed naturally in any of those files. *)
