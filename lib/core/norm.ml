(* Evaluation of terms and evaluation of case trees are technically separate things.  In particular, evaluating a kinetic (standard) term always produces just a value, whereas evaluating a potential term (a function case tree) can either

   1. Produce a new partially-evaluated case tree that isn't fully applied yet.  This is actually represented by a value that's either a Lam or a Struct.
   2. Reach a leaf and produce a value.
   3. Conclude that the case tree is true neutral and will never reduce further.

   These possibilities are encoded in an "evaluation", defined in Syntax.Value.  The point is that, just as with the representation of terms, there is enough commonality between the two (application of lambdas and field projection from structs) that we don't want to duplicate the code, so we define the evaluation functions to return an "evaluation" result that is a GADT parametrized by the kind of energy of the term. *)

(* Look up a value in an environment by variable index.  The result has to have a degeneracy action applied (from the actions stored in the environment).  Thus this depends on being able to act on a value by a degeneracy, so we can't define it until after act.ml is loaded (unless we do open recursive trickery). *)
